      <p> Espresso is coffee brewed by forcing a small <br>amount of nearly boiling water under <br> pressure through finely ground coffee<br>beans. </p>
  <p> Espresso is generally thicker than <br> coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended <br> and dissolved solids, and has crema <br> on top (a foam with creamy <br> consistency.)</p>
    <p> Tamping down the coffee promotes the<br> water's even penetration of the grounds. This process produces an almost syrupy <br>beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved.</p>
